As an individual, you set your typical paths and time windows; as a fleet, we integrate with your existing routes. We only offer jobs that fit these patterns, so you can earn more without redesigning your day."},q2:{question:"What types of carriers and vehicles can join?",answer:"We support walkers, cyclists, private cars, vans, and trucks, as well as fleets and mobility operators in selected areas. The jobs you see depend on your vehicle type, local regulations, and what you want to carry."},q3:{question:"How do payouts work for carriers and fleets?",answer:"You see the payout for each job upfront before you accept. Once a delivery is completed and confirmed, it's added to your balance and paid out on a regular schedule, with instant or same-day options where available. Fleets receive consolidated reports by route and period."},q4:{question:"How does GoLynk protect my operations, customers, and SLAs?",answer:"Our matching engine respects your time windows, detour limits, vehicle constraints, and compliance rules. We only fill unused capacity on lanes you're already planning, so your core customers and SLAs remain your first priority."},q5:{question:"What does integration look like for fleets and operators?",answer:"You can start with the GoLynk dashboard and pilot a corridor without changing your TMS. When you're ready, we offer APIs and data feeds so routes, capacity, and events sync automatically with the systems you already use."},q6:{question:"How are safety, insurance, and liability handled for carriers?",answer:"We work with carriers and fleets to ensure appropriate insurance and liability coverage based on country, vehicle type, and shipment categories. Tasks include clear instructions and proof-of-delivery logging, and in-app support helps resolve issues quickly if something goes wrong."},viewAll:"More questions?
