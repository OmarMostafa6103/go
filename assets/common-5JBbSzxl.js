We orchestrate unused capacity to create a woven, efficient logistics web."},{"category":"businesses","question":"What problem does GoLynk solve?","answer":"Today, logistics is fragmented and wasteful: trucks run 20–35% empty, cars operate at only 30% capacity, and shippers pay premium rates for inefficient routing. GoLynk matches shipments to available capacity in real time, eliminating waste and reducing costs for everyone."},{"category":"businesses","question":"How is GoLynk different from traditional couriers?","answer":"Traditional couriers own vehicles and charge fixed rates. GoLynk doesn't own vehicles; instead, we coordinate shipments across existing capacity (trucks, trains, vans, bikes) and microhubs, which enables lower costs, more flexibility, and no new infrastructure—just smarter coordination."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Is GoLynk a courier, a marketplace, or something else?","answer":"GoLynk is logistics infrastructure: not a vehicle-owning courier, not a manual load board, and not a pure marketplace. We are the orchestration layer that connects capacity intelligently for mutual network benefit."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Who does GoLynk serve?","answer":"Shippers (e-commerce, retailers, B2B and individuals), logistics operators & 3PLs (fleets with unused capacity), and microhub & retail partners (shops, kiosks, lockers). All three benefit from the same intelligent orchestration engine."},{"category":"businesses","question":"How long has GoLynk been operating?","answer":"GoLynk is in pilot phase with early operator and shipper partners in Germany; we're validating the model with real shipments and data before broader scaling—early adopters shape the product and enjoy favorable terms."},{"category":"businesses","question":"How do I get started as a shipper?","answer":"Three simple steps: 1) Sign up via app or web (2 minutes), 2) Enter your first shipment details (pickup, drop-off, package size, timing), 3) Book and track. No minimums, no contracts, no setup fees—most shippers test with one delivery and then integrate."},{"category":"businesses","question":"What types of shipments can I send?","answer":"We handle standard parcels, boxes, and larger shipments up to pallet level. We support regular goods, fresh/temperature-sensitive items (via certified partners), recommerce returns, retail distribution, and bulk industrial items. Regulated categories require verified partners."},{"category":"businesses","question":"What are typical cost savings with GoLynk?","answer":"Most shippers save 30–50% on delivery costs compared to traditional couriers. Savings depend on shipment type, frequency, and corridor; flexible timing typically yields the highest savings."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Can I choose between fast and economical delivery?","answer":"Yes. Options: Economical (2–3 days, consolidation), Express (1–2 days, priority routing), Premium (white-glove, temp-controlled, insured). Choose per shipment based on urgency and budget."},{"category":"businesses","question":"How does tracking work for my customers?","answer":"You receive live GPS tracking, event notifications, and proof-of-delivery data for sharing with customers. Track and embed links for transparency."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Can GoLynk integrate with my e-commerce or TMS system?","answer":"Yes: REST APIs for order creation/status/tracking, webhooks for real-time notifications, and CSV bulk upload for batch shipments. We also provide a dashboard for manual or trial shipments."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Are there volume discounts?","answer":"Pricing is transparent and dynamic rather than strictly volume-tiered. Higher-frequency shippers benefit from better match rates and network density which can improve pricing; large accounts can discuss custom arrangements."},{"category":"businesses","question":"What is proof of delivery?","answer":"POD includes photos at pickup/final delivery, digital signatures or QR scans at handovers, GPS timestamps, and event logs—stored securely for audits and disputes."},{"category":"businesses","question":"How is pricing calculated?","answer":"Transparent, dynamic pricing tied to route and capacity used: Economical (consolidation), Express (priority), Premium (specialized). No monthly minimums—pay for what you ship."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Can I get a custom quote before shipping?","answer":"Yes—use our pricing tool with origin/destination/package/timing for an instant quote; contact our team for detailed enterprise analysis."},{"category":"businesses","question":"What delivery times should I expect?","answer":"Economical: 2–3 days; Express: 1–2 days; Premium: same-day or next-day in select corridors. Exact times depend on origin, destination, and network density."},{"category":"businesses","question":"Do you offer trial shipments?","answer":"We offer test shipments at standard pricing so you can validate the platform before committing; many shippers start with 5–10 test orders."},{"category":"businesses","question":"How does GoLynk make money?","answer":"Revenue from transaction fees on matched shipments, optional premium services (express, insurance, white-glove), and B2B SaaS (data, ESG reporting). This lets us keep per-shipment prices attractive while building a sustainable business."},{"category":"travel","question":"How does a shipment move through GoLynk?","answer":"A shipper enters pickup/drop-off details; our AI matches the shipment to available capacity (direct or multi-hop via microhubs/lockers). The shipment moves along that capacity with live tracking and event updates—no detours, just efficient routing."},{"category":"travel","question":"What is \\"multimodal\\" delivery?","answer":"Multimodal means a shipment can use multiple transport types—truck, train, van, bike, or pedestrian legs—whichever is most efficient for that route, enabling cost and emissions savings."},{"category":"travel","question":"What are microhubs and how do they work?","answer":"Microhubs are small physical consolidation points (corner shops, kiosks, train stations, depots) where shipments temporarily consolidate and wait for the next efficient leg, enabling dynamic rerouting and cost savings."},{"category":"travel","question":"What is a dynamic locker?","answer":"A dynamic locker is a smart parcel locker enabling contactless 24/7 handovers between carriers, shippers, and recipients, eliminating coordination overhead and providing flexible pickup/drop-off across cities."},{"category":"travel","question":"How does GoLynk's matching engine work?","answer":"Our AI analyzes location, timing, capacity, compliance, and detour tolerance to match shipments with compatible journeys automatically, learning from every shipment to improve match quality continuously."},{"category":"travel","question":"How real-time is the tracking?","answer":"We provide live GPS tracking and event-level updates at each leg (pickup, microhub arrival, vehicle boarding, final delivery) with notifications at key milestones and frequently updating ETAs."},{"category":"travel","question":"How do I get started as a logistics operator?","answer":"Apply (share fleet/routes), provide route data (API or upload), pilot one corridor, and scale—no TMS changes required and payouts are automatic."},{"category":"travel","question":"Why would my fleet work with GoLynk?","answer":"Fleets often operate at 60–70% utilization with 20–35% empty backhauls; GoLynk fills spare capacity with compatible shipments to provide incremental profit without changing operations."},{"category":"travel","question":"Do I need to change my TMS or systems?","answer":"No—GoLynk integrates lightly via API or dashboard and fits alongside your existing systems; your core TMS and dispatch stay unchanged."},{"category":"travel","question":"How are operators compensated?","answer":"Operators receive fair compensation per matched shipment, settled automatically (typically weekly/biweekly) with transparent reporting showing route contributions and settlements."},{"category":"travel","question":"What if a matched shipment conflicts with my SLA?","answer":"Our matching engine avoids conflicts by honoring time windows, compliance, and detour constraints; in rare issues GoLynk handles resolution to protect your operations."},{"category":"travel","question":"Can I control which routes or shipments I accept?","answer":"Yes—enable matching only on specific routes, time windows, or shipment types; exclude destinations; and toggle matching as needed to test and scale at your pace."},{"category":"travel","question":"How does this work alongside my existing customers?","answer":"Your customer relationships and SLAs remain separate—GoLynk only fills unused capacity on legs you've planned so core obligations aren’t compromised."},{"category":"environmental","question":"How does GoLynk reduce emissions?","answer":"By filling empty vehicle space and eliminating unnecessary trips, GoLynk reduces CO₂ per package by 40–70% vs traditional dedicated delivery; multimodal routing and microhubs further cut footprint."},{"category":"environmental","question":"How is carbon impact measured and reported?","answer":"We calculate CO₂ savings per shipment vs a conventional alternative, aggregate results into auditable reports, and provide third-party verifiable Scope 3-ready data."},{"category":"environmental","question":"How does GoLynk support ESG and CSRD compliance?","answer":"We produce auditable CO₂ savings reports suitable for CSRD and ESG reporting that are third-party verifiable and support corporate sustainability commitments."},{"category":"security","question":"How does GoLynk ensure trust and security?","answer":"Through KYC & verification, insurance options, proof-of-delivery logging (GPS/photos/signatures), rating & reputation systems, and GDPR-compliant data practices."},{"category":"security","question":"Is insurance included?","answer":"Base coverage is included for standard shipments; optional premium insurance is available for high-value items with higher coverage limits."},{"category":"security","question":"How does GoLynk ensure data privacy?","answer":"All data is encrypted end-to-end and stored securely; GoLynk complies with GDPR and never shares sensitive operational/pricing data without permission."},{"category":"security","question":"Is GoLynk regulated by logistics authorities?","answer":"Yes—GoLynk operates in compliance with EU and German logistics regulations, insurance requirements, and data protection laws; partners undergo KYC and maintain appropriate insurance."},{"category":"community","question":"How can I contact GoLynk's team?","answer":"Contact via chat on the website, email, phone for B2B partners, or request a demo. For shippers start with a test shipment and chat with support during tracking."},{"category":"community","question":"What if I'm in a region GoLynk doesn't yet serve?","answer":"Join our waitlist, reach out to discuss becoming an early pilot partner, or provide feedback on which corridors matter most to you."},{"category":"community","question":"What's GoLynk's vision for the future?","answer":"A woven, intelligent logistics network across Europe where shipments move through nodes and transport edges with minimal human intervention, optimized in real time for cost, carbon, and speed—making existing infrastructure vastly smarter."}]}`),c={heading:"Our locations",description:"Say hello to our friendly team at one of these locations.",melbourne:{city:"Melbourne, AUS",address:`100 Smith Street
