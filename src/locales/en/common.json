      {
        "question": "What is GoLynk?",
        "answer": "GoLynk is an AI-powered logistics platform that intelligently routes shipments through a network of existing vehicles, trains, microhubs, and lockers—delivering faster, cheaper, and with significantly lower emissions than traditional courier services. We orchestrate unused capacity to create a woven, efficient logistics web."
      },
      {
        "question": "What problem does GoLynk solve?",
        "answer": "Today, logistics is fragmented and wasteful: trucks run 20–35% empty, cars operate at only 30% capacity, and shippers pay premium rates for inefficient routing. GoLynk matches shipments to available capacity in real time, eliminating waste and reducing costs for everyone."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is GoLynk different from traditional couriers?",
        "answer": "Traditional couriers own vehicles and charge fixed rates. GoLynk doesn't own vehicles; instead, we coordinate shipments across existing capacity (trucks, trains, vans, bikes) and microhubs, which enables lower costs, more flexibility, and no new infrastructure—just smarter coordination."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who does GoLynk serve?",
        "answer": "Shippers (e-commerce, retailers, B2B and individuals), logistics operators & 3PLs (fleets with unused capacity), and microhub & retail partners (shops, kiosks, lockers). All three benefit from the same intelligent orchestration engine."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are typical cost savings with GoLynk?",
        "answer": "Most shippers save 30–50% on delivery costs compared to traditional couriers. Savings depend on shipment type, frequency, and corridor; flexible timing typically yields the highest savings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I choose between fast and economical delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes. Options: Economical (2–3 days, consolidation), Express (1–2 days, priority routing), Premium (white-glove, temp-controlled, insured). Choose per shipment based on urgency and budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does tracking work for my customers?",
        "answer": "You receive live GPS tracking, event notifications, and proof-of-delivery data for sharing with customers. Track and embed links for transparency."
