      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to replace my current carriers or freight partners?",
        "answer": "No. GoLynk is an orchestration layer on top of your existing carriers and lanes. You can keep trusted partners, expose their spare capacity into GoLynk, and let the engine decide when to use your own network, GoLynk's crowd and fleet capacity, or a mix of both."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does GoLynk keep my shipments safe and compliant?",
        "answer": "Shipments are matched to vetted carriers and routes based on handling needs, value, and any sector‑specific requirements. For sensitive flows—like fresh, fragile, or healthcare—GoLynk uses specialist carriers, shorter hops, and clear event trails to support insurance and compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do pricing and costs work for shippers?",
        "answer": "Pricing reflects how well a shipment fits existing routes and capacity, rather than fixed, one‑size‑fits‑all rates. That means you can unlock lower costs when GoLynk fills empty space, backhauls, and returning journeys—without sacrificing service levels."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do we integrate GoLynk with our systems?",
        "answer": "You can start via dashboards and then move to API integration with your TMS, WMS, e‑commerce platform, or ERP. Orders, events, and CO₂ data can flow automatically, so your teams don't need to maintain a separate tool just to use GoLynk."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you calculate CO₂ impact for our shipments?",
        "answer": "For each shipment, GoLynk estimates emissions using conservative baseline factors and compares them against what a typical courier or truck move would have emitted. The result is per‑shipment and per‑lane avoided‑emissions data you can export into ESG and sustainability reporting."
